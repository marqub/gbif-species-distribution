Project Plan

The goal of this project is to use the GBIF dataset to explore the relationships between species distribution and environmental variables, and to build a machine learning model to predict species distribution based on these variables. The project will be divided into three phases:

# Phase 1: Data Exploration and Visualization (Weeks 1-3)

The goal of this phase is to get a better understanding of the GBIF dataset and explore the relationships between different variables in the data.

## Objectives

- Familiarize yourself with the structure and content of the GBIF dataset by reading through the documentation and examining the data itself.
- Explore the data using various visualization techniques, such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots, to identify trends and patterns.
- Begin to formulate hypotheses about the relationships between different variables in the data, such as the relationship between species distribution and environmental variables.
- Write a brief report summarizing your findings from the data exploration phase.

## Skills to Learn

- Data exploration and visualization:
  - Pandas functions: `head()`, `describe()`, `plot()`
  - Matplotlib functions: `hist()`, `scatter()`, `boxplot()`
- Data manipulation with Pandas:
  - Handling missing values: `dropna()`, `fillna()`
  - Removing duplicates: `drop_duplicates()`
  - Normalizing data: `minmax_scale()`
  - Encoding categorical variables: `get_dummies()`
- Plotting with Matplotlib:
  - Customizing plots: `xlabel()`, `ylabel()`, `title()`, `legend()`

# Phase 2: Feature Engineering and Model Training (Weeks 4-6)

The goal of this phase is to prepare the data for machine learning by selecting and engineering relevant features, and to train a machine learning model to predict species distribution based on these features.

## Objectives

- Select relevant features from the GBIF dataset using feature selection techniques such as chi-squared test or mutual information.
- Engineer additional features by creating new derived variables or combining existing variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding or polynomial expansion.
- Split the data into training and test sets using a stratified sampling method to ensure a representative sample of the target variable.
- Train a machine learning model, such as a random forest or a gradient boosting model, to predict species distribution based on the selected and engineered features.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Write a brief report summarizing your findings from the model training phase.
